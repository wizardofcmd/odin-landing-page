      <p id="babs-quote">Dad thinks I'm too short. My Sensei thinks I'm too "girly". But just like the principles of
        jujitsuâ€” I use their expectations against them. That will be their weakness. Not mine. Let them all
        underestimate me. Let them think they have the upper hand over the little girl. Let them relax while the
        adrenaline leaks out of their systems. Let them believe they're closing their grips on a shrinking violet. And
        when their guard is down and their pride is rising... let me kick their butts up around their ears.</p>
